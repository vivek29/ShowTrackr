# ShowTrackr---MEAN

Create a TV Show Tracker using MEAN stack.

- The front-end will be built using AngularJS and Bootstrap Sass.


- Used AngularStrap to Add quick, dynamic navbar functionality to transition through active/inactive states.
(Preferred over Bootstrap NavBar, so that the active class is applied automatically to the "li" elements when we change routes. Also other advantages like awesome directives that integrate with AngualrJS such as Alert, Typeahead, Tooltip, Tab and many more.)


- Use Gulp to compile Sass stylesheets. 
(Gulp is a fast and intuitive streaming build tool built on Node.js and is same as Grunt with some advantages)
